# Image Clipboard for Unity
A library that allows you to copy and paste images from **Windows** desktop into UnityEngine

### How to Use
1. Download the `.dll` from [Releases](https://github.com/Haoming02/image-clipboard-for-unity/releases)
2. Download the `.cs` script
3. Call `ImageClipboard.Paste` to receive the image currently in clipboard
    - If successful, the function returns `true`, otherwise *(**eg.** you copied text instead of image)* it will return `false`

- Refer to the [src](https://github.com/Haoming02/image-clipboard-for-unity/tree/src) branch for the source code of the `.dll` library
